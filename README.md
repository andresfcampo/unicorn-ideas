Welcome to Unicorn Ideas

This project is a public forum where you can post a startup idea and get some quick "opinions" from other users from the forum. Of course opinions won't be the factor that determine your success but they can be useful to read other's perspective on what you are building. 

This forum has three core features:

1) Posting startup ideas in a max of 136 characters and categorizing them into an industry.
2) Interacting with startup ideas, like upvoting and commenting other's ideas.
3) Following other people's accounts. 
4) Chatting with other users? *Maybe we build this.*
